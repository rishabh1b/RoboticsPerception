# TrafficSignRecognition
This project will make an attempt to effectively recognize and classify traffic signs from a real-world data set. 
MATLAB is used in the implementation
The first step is to segment out the region of interests. A combination of MSER and color thresholding is applied at this point of time to
get the blue and signs region. [MORE DETAILS WILL COME]
A HOG-SVM based claasification will be used. For detecting HOG features and MSER vl_feat library is used. The binary package can be 
downloaded from here - http://www.vlfeat.org/install-matlab.html. Make sure to follow the one-time setup on the website.
